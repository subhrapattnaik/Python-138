Data Collection : Data is used to create more efficient systems
Recommendation systems are a type of information filtering system as they improve the quality of search results and provide items that are more relevant to the searched item or are related to the search history

Amazon uses this to suggest products 

Youtube uses it to decide which video to plan next on autoplay 

Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow

Companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly n the effectivness of their recommendation engines for their business 


There are mainly three types of recommendation systems 

1) Demographic filtering (A particular sector of a population)
a-they offer generalized recomendations to every user, based on movie popularity
b-the system recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features 
c-since each user is different this approach is considered to be to simple 
d- the basic idea behind this system is that movies which more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience

2) Content-based Filtering :
they suggest similar items based on a particular item.
the system uses item meta-data such as genre, director,description,actors etc or movies to make these recommendations
the general idea behind this recommendation system is that if a person likes a particular item he/she will also like an item that is similar to it 

3) Collaborative Filtering :
this system matches persons woth similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching 
Collaborative filters do not require item meta-data like it's Content based couterparts
